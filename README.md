# basic-web-page
Hello peeps! 👩‍💻

This is a basic landing page that I created from scratch on 'Night Sky' 🌃. yeah, I am a sucker for starry skies. 💫

It was built as final project of a basics workshop I attended on web development in Dec, 2022 during the Christmas break 🎄
I used fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used VS Code and Google Chrome.

P.S. even though the page does not look as good as I wanted it to be, I am still proud of myself. One more thing off my bucketlist :)
